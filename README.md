# sentello
Sentello is python script that simulates the anti-evasion and anti-analysis techniques used by malware.

Inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UGUQA8tsv0)

For techniques that are difficult to implement on Python, Al-Khaser was converted into a DLL and used. (vm-detector.dll)
